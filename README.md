## My Profile Website

Hello, I am Fawzi al-Dubhani from Yemen. I live and work in Germany since October 2015. It is my first profile Website. I just used html and css which I learned till now at the school -DCI- We also leanred sass which is very usefull and helpful to write less codes, but still need to practice more and also in this step of my profile Website I didn't need it but later in the second version when I will add more informaion and more icons for sure I will need to use sass. This project is the result of what I learned at DCI and also with some refernaces from YouTube which was really helpfull too. I made my Website in a very simple way with out many effects or many colors, I just used one color in two gradient (light and dark) which is my favorite color "the Blue" and also it is a color which is popular and nice for many people.

## Appendix

In the second version of my profile Website I will add some simple effects and also link it with some of the projects which I worked in.

## Content

In my profile Website I have seven sections which are (About, Education, Works, Skills, Gallery, profile, and main). In the work section I share just short information which is the main information related to my work position and all other inormation about my work experinces and my training and activities are in my CV which is available for download from the profile section, and also there is a contact page.
