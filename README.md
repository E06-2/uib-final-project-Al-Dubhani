# My Profile Website

Hello,
I am Fawzi al-Dubhani from Yemen. I live and work in Germany since October 2015.
It is my first profile Website. I just used html and css which I learned till now at the school -DCI- We also leanred sass which is very usefull and helpful to write less codes, but still need to practice more and also in this step of my profile Website I didn't need it but later in the second version when I will add more informaion and more icons for sure I will need to use sass. 
This project is the result of what I learned at DCI and also with some refernaces from YouTube which was really helpfull too.
I made my Website in a very simple way with out many effects or many colors, I just used one color in two gradient (light and dark) which is my favorite color "the Blue" and also it is a color which is popular and nice for many people.   

## Appendix

In the second version of my profile Website I will add some simple effects and also link it with some of the projects which I worked in.
